This exercise revolves around creating classes for the following geometric shapes: Rectangle, Isosceles Triangle, Diamond, and Window. The task involves constructing suitable constructors and functions based on the exercise instructions. Additionally, we are required to define appropriate class fields.

Files we've created:
- Rectangle.h: Definition of the Rectangle class.
- Rectangle.cpp: Implementation of constructors and functions for the Rectangle class.
- IsoscelesTriangle.h: Definition of the Isosceles Triangle class.
- IsoscelesTriangle.cpp: Implementation of constructors and functions for the Isosceles Triangle class.
- Diamond.h: Definition of the Diamond class.
- Diamond.cpp: Implementation of functions and constructors for the Diamond class.
- Window.h: Definition of the Window class.
- Window.cpp: Implementation of functions and constructors for the Window class.

Key Data Structures:
- Classes for the four geometric shapes as per the exercise definition.
